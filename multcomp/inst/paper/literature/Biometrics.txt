AB To support the design of the world's first proof-of-concept (POC)
   efficacy trial of a cell-mediated immunity-based HIV vaccine, we
   evaluate eight methods for testing the composite null hypothesis of
   no-vaccine effect on either the incidence of HIV infection or the viral
   load set point among those infected, relative to placebo. The first two
   methods use a single test applied to the actual values or ranks of a
   burden-of-illness (BOT) outcome that combines the infection and viral
   load endpoints. The other six methods combine separate tests for the
   two endpoints using unweighted or weighted versions of the two-part z,
   Simes', and Fisher's methods. Based on extensive simulations that were
   used to design the landmark POC trial, the BOI methods are shown to
   have generally low power for rejecting the composite null hypothesis
   (and hence advancing the vaccine to a subsequent large-scale efficacy
   trial). The unweighted Simes' and Fisher's combination methods perform
   best overall. Importantly, this conclusion holds even after the test
   for the viral load component is adjusted for bias that can be
   introduced by conditioning on a postrandomization event (HIV
   infection). The adjustment is derived using a selection bias model
   based on the principal stratification framework of causal inference.

ID SELECTION
AB The analysis of data from dose-response studies has long been divided
   according to two major strategies: multiple comparison procedures and
   model-based approaches. Model-based approaches assume a functional
   relationship between the response and the dose, taken as a quantitative
   factor, according to a prespecified parametric model. The fitted model
   is then used to estimate an adequate dose to achieve a desired response
   but the validity of its conclusions will highly depend on the correct
   choice of the a priori unknown dose-response model. Multiple comparison
   procedures regard the dose as a qualitative factor and make very few,
   if any, assumptions about the underlying dose-response model. The
   primary goal is often to identify the minimum effective dose that is
   statistically significant and produces a relevant biological effect.
   One approach is to evaluate the significance of contrasts between
   different dose levels, while preserving the family-wise error rate.
   Such procedures are relatively robust but inference is confined to the
   selection of the target dose among the dose levels under investigation.
   We describe a unified strategy to the analysis of data from
   dose-response studies which combines multiple comparison and modeling
   techniques. We assume the existence of several candidate parametric
   models and use multiple comparison techniques to choose the one most
   likely to represent the true underlying dose-response curve, while
   preserving the family-wise error rate. The selected model is then used
   to provide inference on adequate doses.

   The authors address both goals though with focus on the second by
   closure procedures that guarantee strong control of the familywise

   for bi-factorial dose-response designs that are monotone with respect
   to the matrix partial order. One is suitable to find the minimum
   effective dose(s) and the other one is large enough to identify the
   highest effective dose step(s). Likelihood ratio tests and appropriate
   multiple contrast tests are applied to an unbalanced clinical trial
   example taken from Hung (2000, Statistics in Medicine 19, 2079-2087).

ID DUNNETT
AB In clinical studies, multiple superiority/equivalence testing
   procedures can be applied to classify a new treatment as superior,
   equivalent (same therapeutic effect), or inferior to each set of
   standard treatments. Previous stepwise approaches (Dunnett and Tamhane,
   1997, Statistics in Medicine 16, 2489-2506; Kwong, 2001, Journal of
   Statistical Planning and Inference 97, 359-366) are only appropriate
   for balanced designs. Unfortunately, the construction of similar tests
   for unbalanced designs is far more complex, with two major
   difficulties: (i) the ordering of test statistics for superiority may
   not be the same as the ordering of test statistics for equivalence; and
   (ii) the correlation structure of the test statistics is not
   equi-correlated but product-correlated. In this article, we seek to
   develop a two-stage testing procedure for unbalanced designs, which are
   very popular in clinical experiments. This procedure is a combination
   of step-up and single-step testing procedures, while the familywise
   error rate is proved to be controlled at a designated level.
   Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted to compare the average
   powers of the proposed procedure to those of the single-step procedure.
   In addition, a clinical example is provided to illustrate the
   application of the new procedure.

AB A method is proposed for classifying subjects according to their
   convex, flat, or concave change patterns of 24-hours blood pressure
   measurements. To obtain such a classification is useful for detecting
   subjects who show abnormal change patterns and giving them appropriate
   medical treatments. Therefore, an appropriate statistic is proposed for
   detecting a systematic change along the time axis, as well as a
   statistic with its inverse characteristic appropriate for evaluating
   the noise variation. The method is based on the ratio of those two
   types of statistics; it is verified to work well on real data, giving a
   classification of subjects into four types of subgroups: extreme
   dipper, dipper, nondipper, and inverted dipper. It also suggests that
   there might be an ultra-extreme dipper subgroup.

AB In studying the relationship between an ordered categorical predictor
   and an event time, it is standard practice to include dichotomous
   indicators of the different levels of the predictor in a Cox model. One
   can then use a multiple degree-of-freedom score or partial likelihood
   ratio test for hypothesis testing. Often, interest focuses on comparing
   the null hypothesis of no difference to an order-restricted
   alternative, such as a monotone increase across levels of a predictor.
   This article proposes a Bayesian approach for addressing hypotheses of
   this type. We reparameterize the Cox model in terms of a cumulative
   product of parameters having conjugate prior densities, consisting of
   mixtures of point masses at one, and truncated gamma densities. Due to
   the structure of the model, posterior computation can proceed via a
   simple and efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm. Posterior probabilities
   for the global null hypothesis and subhypotheses, comparing the hazards
   for specific groups, can be calculated directly from the output of a
   single Gibbs chain. The approach allows for level sets across which a
   predictor has no effect. Generalizations to multiple predictors are
   described, and the method is applied to a study of emergency medical
   treatment for stroke.

AB In clinical studies involving multiple variables, simultaneous tests

   treatment effects, that allows positive probability of zero effect for
   each hypothesis, correlations among effect sizes, correlations among
   binary outcomes of zero versus nonzero effect, and correlations among
   the observed test statistics (conditional on the effects). We develop a

   situation with unknown covariance structure, and obtain the posterior
   probabilities of no difference between treatment regimens for specific
   variables. Prior selection methods and robustness issues are discussed
   in the context of a clinical example.

AB Did the biodiversity of dinosaurs decline, or did it remain more or
   less constant before their mass extinction 65 million years ago?
   Sheehan et al. (1991, Science, 835-839) reported that the biodiversity
   of families of dinosaur species remained more or less constant
   preceding their extinction, suggesting extinction due to a cataclysmic
   event such as an asteroid strike. But that claim was based on the
   incorrect interpretation that a large p value associated with a test of
   null hypothesis of equality supports that null hypothesis. To assess
   whether there is a basis for such a claim, we formulate the problem as
   one of practical equivalence, in analogy to bioequivalence. We then
   develop reliable practical equivalence confidence intervals for
   differences of entropies by applying the bootstrap-t technique to a
   nearly pivotal quantity. Confidence intervals for changes in the
   biodiversity of dinosaurs are then computed, allowing the reader to
   assess whether there is evidence of near constancy of dinosaur
   biodiversity before extinction.

AB Tarone (1990, Biometrics 46, 515-522) proposed a multiple test
   procedure for discrete test statistics improving the usual Bonferroni
   procedure. However, Tarone's procedure is not monotone depending on the
   predetermined multiple level alpha. Roth (1998, Journal of Statistical
   Planning and inference, in press) developed a monotone version of
   Tarone's procedure. We present a similar procedure that is both
   monotone and an improvement of Tarone's proposal. Based on this
   extension, we derive a step-down procedure that is a corresponding
   improvement of Helm's (1979, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 6,
   65-70) sequentially rejective procedure. It is shown how adjusted
   p-values can be computed for the monotone procedures. Finally, the
   described ideas are applied to the concept of Ruger tests.

AB This paper describes a permutational step-up multiple comparison
   procedure to adjust the p values from k related hypotheses. The method
   is applicable when two groups of subjects are being compared on each of
   k outcomes. It is related to the step-down method of Westfall and Young
   (1993, Resampling-Based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for
   P-Value Adjustment, Volume 1) and Troendle (1995, Journal of the
   American Statistical Association 90, 370-378) and is an alternative to
   the analytic step-up method of Dunnett and Tamhane (1992, Journal of
   the American Statistical Association. 87, 162-170), which requires a
   specific distribution and correlation structure. By conditioning on the
   data observed, this permutational method avoids any specific
   distribution or correlation assumption. It is shown very generally that
   the method asymptotically controls the familywise probability of a type
   I error.

ID RISK
AB The problem of identifying the lowest dose level for which the mean
   response differs from that at the zero dose level is considered. A
   general framework for stepwise testing procedures that use contrasts
   among the dose level means is proposed. Using this framework, several
   new procedures are derived. These and some existing procedures,
   including that of Williams (1971, Biometrics 27, 103-117; 1972,
   Biometrics 28, 519-531), are compared analytically and by an extensive
   simulation study for the normal theory balanced one-way layout case. It
   is pointed out that the procedures based on the so-called step and
   basin contrasts proposed by Ruberg (1989, Journal of American
   Statistical Association 84, 816-822) have excessively high type I
   familywise error rates (FWEs) and, hence, they should not be used. Some
   findings of the simulation study are as follows: For monotone dose mean
   configurations, Williams' procedure and two step-down test procedures
   based on Helmert and linear contrasts offer the best performance. For
   nonmonotone dose mean configurations, the performance of Williams'
   procedure does degrade somewhat, but the other two procedures are still
   the best. For more complex designs, a simple step-down test procedure
   that uses any ct-level tests (not necessarily t-tests) to compare each
   dose level with the zero dose level controls the FWE and is the only
   alternative available, but its power is rather low, especially under
   nommonotone configurations. Step-up procedures are generally dominated
   by step-down procedures when the same contrasts are used although the
   differences are not great.
