AB SiZer is a powerful method for exploratory data analysis. In this
   article approximations to the distributions underlying the simultaneous
   statistical inference are investigated, and large improvements are made
   in the approximation using extreme value theory. This results in
   improved size, and also in an improved global inference version of
   SiZer. The main points are illustrated with real data and simulated
   examples.

AB In recent work we introduced a general, a weak, and a strong
   partitioning principles for the construction of multiple decision
   procedures as multiple testing or selection procedures. Partitioning
   principles can be viewed as natural extensions of the closure principle
   and sometimes yield more powerful decision procedures. In this article
   we consider the problem of establishing equivalence with the best with
   respect to k treatment means, where equivalence is defined in terms of
   a threshold value delta > 0. We reformulate the original selection
   problem as a multiple testing problem and develop various step-down and
   step-up procedures by applying the closure principle and partitioning
   principles. The new step-down procedure is shown to provide a uniform
   improvement over procedures currently in use. Moreover, we propose some
   projection methods that yield confidence intervals being compatible
   with stepwise tests and selection procedures.

AB Consider the problem of testing k hypotheses simultaneously. In this
   article we discuss finite- and large-sample theory of stepdown methods
   that provide control of the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve on
   the Bonferroni method or on Holm's stepdown method, Westfall and Young
   made effective use of resampling to construct stepdown methods that
   implicitly estimate the dependence structure of the test statistics.
   However, their methods depend on an assumption known as "subset
   pivotality." Our goal here is to construct general stepdown methods
   that do not require such an assumption. To accomplish this, we take a
   close look at what makes stepdown procedures work; a key component is a
   monotonicity requirement of critical values. By imposing monotonicity
   on estimated critical values (which is not an assumption on the model
   but rather is an assumption on the method), we show how to construct
   stepdown tests that can be applied in a stagewise fashion so that at
   most k tests need to be computed. Moreover, at each stage, an
   intersection test that controls the usual probability of a type 1 error
   is calculated, which allows us to draw on an enormous resampling
   literature as a general means of test construction. In addition, it is
   possible to carry out this method using the same set of resamples (or
   subsamples) for each of the intersection tests.

AB Research on multiple comparison during the past 50 years or so has
   focused mainly on the comparison of several population means. Several
   years ago. Spurrier considered the multiple comparison of several
   simple linear regression lines. He constructed simultaneous confidence
   bands for all of the contrasts of the simple linear regression lines
   over the entire range (-infinity, infinity) when the models have the
   same design matrices. This article extends Spurrier's work in several
   directions. First. multiple linear regression models are considered and
   the design matrices are allowed to be different. Second. the predictor
   variables are either unconstrained or constrained to finite intervals.
   Third, the types of comparison allowed can be very flexible, including
   pairwise. many-one, and successive. Two simulation methods are proposed
   for the calculation of critical constants. The methodologies are
   illustrated with examples.

   error rate; multiple comparisons; multivariate t-distribution;

ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; EFFICACY
AB We address the problem of determining the therapeutic window of a drug
   by finding its minimum effective and maximum safe doses (MINED and
   MAXSD), The MINED is the lowest dose that exceeds the mean efficacy of
   the zero dose by a specified threshold, and the MAXSD is the highest
   dose that does not exceed the mean toxicity of the zero dose by a
   specified threshold. Step-down multiple test procedures are proposed to
   identify the MINED and MAXSD assuming a bivariate normal model. These
   procedures control the type I familywise error probability of declaring
   any ineffective dose as effective or any unsafe dose as safe at a
   prespecified level alpha. A new multivariate t-distribution is
   introduced whose critical points are required to implement the exact
   normal theory procedures. Because these critical points depend on the
   unknown correlation coefficient between the efficacy and safety
   variables, the Bonferroni method is proposed as an alternative, which
   amounts to separately testing for efficacy and safety, each at type I
   familywise error rate of alpha/2. The bootstrap versions of the exact
   normal theory procedures provide an approximate way to jointly test for
   efficacy and safety without the knowledge of the correlation
   coefficient, as well as to relax the bivariate normality assumption.
   The Bonferroni and bootstrap procedures are compared in a simulation
   study. It is shown that significant power gains are achieved by jointly
   testing for both efficacy and safety using bootstrap procedures, Coded
   data from an arthritis drug trial are analyzed to illustrate the
   procedures.

AB we consider dose response studies for safety assessment of crop
   protection compounds and drugs, and we offer a hypothesis testing
   approach for identifying the maximum dose level that is guaranteed to
   be safe with preassigned confidence. The focus is on step-down (SD)
   multiple test procedures for identifying the maximum safe dose. We
   propose two classes of contrasts among the dose means as test
   statistics for these procedures: pairwise contrasts (PC) and Helmert
   contrasts (HC). The first procedure (SD2PC) consists of a sequence of
   ordinary t tests and is thus easy to apply, but it can have very low
   power for certain step response functions. The second procedure (SD1HC)
   does not suffer from this drawback, but it requires a weak monotonicity
   assumption for its mathematical validity. The powers of SD2PC and SD1HC
   are studied via Monte Carlo simulation. We recommend SD2PC for linear
   response functions and SD1HC for step response functions. The
   procedures are illustrated by applying them to data from an aquatic
   toxicity laboratory experiment conducted to assess the safe level of a
   pesticide.

DE multiple comparison : Scheffe method; simple linear regression;
   simultaneous confidence; union intersection
AB It is desired to compare k greater than or equal to 3 treatments. Under
   the assumption of lid normal errors, it is well known that the Scheffe
   method produces exact simultaneous confidence bounds for all contrasts
   of the treatment means. Furthermore, it is known that the Scheffe
   method is conservative when one desires confidence bounds for a
   specific subset of contrasts of means. Exact methods, such as those due
   to Tukey and Dunnett, yield tighter bounds than the Scheffe method for
   specific subsets of contrasts of means. in this article, multiple
   comparisons of the k treatments are done not in terms of their means,
   but rather in terms of a parametric function. The parametric function
   of interest is the simple linear regression model, E(Y\x). Ir, is
   desired to find simultaneous confidence bounds fur all contrasts of the
   k simple linear regression models. Although the Scheffe method can be
   used to find such bounds, this is extremely conservative. The
   union-intersection method is used to develop simultaneous confidence
   bounds for these contrasts under the assumption of equal design
   matrices for each treatment. The method is based on a pivotal quantity
   whose distribution function is a linear combination of F distribution
   functions. Thus probability points can be computed using standard
   computing packages. The Scheffe bounds are about 5% wider than the
   exact bounds for k = 3 and about 13% wider for k = 6.

ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; MULTIPLE
AB Some parametric tests for comparing several treatments to a control are
   examined. Those tests developed earlier tend to rest on a single
   principle: simplicity or power; those developed later attempt to fill
   the gap. We propose a new test that represents another such attempt.
   The basic idea is to find a simple statistic that is a good
   approximation to the likelihood ratio statistic. This leads to a power
   function similar to that of the likelihood ratio test, which is optimal
   among the available competitors. Like the orthogonal contrast test, the
   new test is built on an orthogonal relationship, resulting in a
   relatively simple null distribution that depends on the sample sizes
   only through their total. Thus critical values can be easily computed
   and a detailed listing results in only a moderately large table.
   Computing the statistic is elementary when the sample sizes of the new
   treatments are equal; otherwise, some matrix operations are needed. A
   simple procedure is given to estimate the sample size required to
   achieve a given power level. To compete with Dunnett's test in terms of
   pairwise comparison, the new test (or any of the other tests) can be
   applied according to the closed testing procedure. In this setting the
   new test is compared to Dunnett's test by simulation.

   foundation rests on a recent inequality due to Naiman. The new method
   is promising in view of the fact that it utilizes information
   (estimator intercorrelations) ignored by the most widely used multiple
   comparison methods yet is not computationally prohibitive, requiring
   only the numerical evaluation of a single one-dimensional integral. In
   this article the validity of the new method in the normal-theoretic
   general linear model is established, and efficiency studies relative to
   the methods of Scheffe, Bonferroni, Sidak, and Hunter-Worsley are
   presented. The new method is shown to always improve on Scheffe's
   method. The new method is also shown to perform well; that is, to lead
   to a smaller critical point than its competitors, with low degrees of
   freedom. But the method is not as efficient as the Hunter-Worsley
   method for high degrees of freedom. In addition, the method appears to
   increase in relative efficiency as the number of comparisons increases
   relative to the rank of the correlation matrix of the estimators.

AB This article introduces a method of multiple hypothesis testing that
   combines the idea of sequential multiple testing procedures with the

   alternative to the analytic method of Dunnett and Tamhane, which
   requires a specific distributional form. Resampling incorporates the
   covariance structure of the data without the need for distributional
   assumptions. Recent work by Westfall and Young has shown that a
   step-down resampling method is asymptotically consistent when adjusted
   p values can be obtained exactly for continuous data. This article
   shows that in the case of a comparison of two groups on multiple
   outcomes, those results are generalizable to discrete data where exact
   adjusted p values are not available. It is shown that the method
   asymptotically attains the desired level for controlling the
   experimentwise probability of a type I error.
