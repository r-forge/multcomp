ID EXACT CONFIDENCE-BOUNDS
AB The frequently used approach to the comparison of two linear regression
   models is to use the partial F test. It is pointed out in this paper
   that the partial F test has in fact a naturally associated two-sided
   simultaneous confidence band, which is much more informative than the
   test itself. But this confidence band is over the entire range of all
   the covariates. As regression models are true or of interest often only
   over a restricted region of the covariates, the part of this confidence
   band outside this region is therefore useless and to ensure 1 - alpha
   simultaneous coverage probability is therefore wasteful of resources.
   It is proposed that a narrower and hence more efficient confidence band
   over a restricted region of the covariates should be used. The critical
   constant required in the construction of this confidence band can be
   calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. While this two-sided confidence
   band is suitable for two-sided comparisons of two linear regression
   models, a more efficient one-sided confidence band can be constructed
   in a similar way if one is only interested in assessing whether the
   mean response of one regression model is higher (or lower) than that of
   the other in the region. The methodologies are illustrated with two
   examples. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   normal distribution; toxicology
AB This paper addresses the problem of power and sample size calculation
   for a stepwise multiple test procedure (SD2PC) proposed in Tamhane et
   al. [2001. Multiple test procedures for identifying the maximum safe
   dose. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 96, 835-843] to identify the maximum
   safe dose of a compound. A general expression for the power of this
   procedure is derived. It is used to find the minimum overall power and
   minimum power under the constraint that the dose response function is
   bounded from below by a linear response function. It is shown that the
   two minima are attained under step and linear response functions,
   respectively. The sample sizes necessary on the zero dose control and
   each of the positive doses to guarantee a specified power requirement
   are calculated under these two least favorable configurations. A
   technique involving a continuous approximation to the sample sizes is
   used to reduce the number of quantities that need to be tabled, and to
   derive the asymptotically optimal allocation of the total. sample size
   between the zero dose and the positive doses. An example is given to
   illustrate use of the tables. Extensions of the basic formulation are
   noted. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ALLOCATION; TABLES
AB In an experiment for comparing two test treatments with a control
   treatment, simultaneous confidence bounds for the amount by which each
   test treatment differs from the control is generally required. When the
   experiment is arranged as a block design, the optimal allocation of
   experimental units within the blocks to the individual test treatments
   and to the control needs to be determined. The optimality criterion of
   interest is the minimization of the expected average allowance (EAA) or
   the expected maximum allowance (EMA), where an allowance represents the
   "plus and/or minus" attached to point estimates and is the product of a
   standard error and the critical value. Lower bounds for the EAA and EMA
   values are provided for both one-sided and two-sided confidence
   intervals. A search algorithm for obtaining efficient designs is
   described. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE multiple testing; strong control; type I error; permutation; bootstrap
ID FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; TEST STATISTICS
AB This paper investigates different choices of test statistic null
   distribution for resampling-based multiple testing in the context of
   single parameter hypotheses. We show that the test statistic null
   distribution for strongly controlling type I error may be obtained by
   projecting the true test statistic distribution onto the space of mean
   zero distributions. For common choices of test statistics, this
   distribution is asymptotically multivariate normal with the covariance
   of the vector influence curve for the parameter estimator. Applying the
   ordinary non-parametric or model-based bootstrap to mean zero centered
   test statistics produces an estimated test statistic null distribution
   which provides asymptotic strong control. In contrast, the usual
   practice of obtaining an estimated test statistic null distribution via
   an estimated data null distribution (e.g. null restricted bootstrap)
   only provides an asymptotically correct test statistic null
   distribution if the covariance of the vector influence curve is the
   same under the chosen data null distribution as under the true data
   distribution. This condition is the formal analogue of the subset
   pivotality condition (Westfall and Young, Resampling-based Multiple
   Testing: Examples and Methods for p-value adjustment, Wiley, New York,
   1993). We demonstrate the use of our proposed ordinary bootstrap null
   distribution with a single-step multiple testing method which is
   equivalent to constructing an error-specific confidence region for the
   true parameter and checking if it contains the hypothesized value. We
   also study the two sample problem and show that the permutation method
   produces an asymptotically correct null distribution if (i) the sample
   sizes are equal or (ii) the populations have the same covariance
   structure. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Consider the balanced one-way layout for comparing k treatment effects
   mu(i), 1 less than or equal to i less than or equal to k. Marcus
   (Biometrika 63 (1976) 177) considers a test procedure for testing the
   null hypothesis H-0: mu(1) = mu(2) = (...) = mu(k) against the simple
   ordered alternative H-A: mu(1) less than or equal to mu(2) less than or
   equal to (...) less than or equal to mu(k) with at least one strict
   inequality based upon the range (&mu;) over cap (k) - (&mu;) over cap
   (1) of the isotonic estimates of the treatment effects. This test
   statistic was originally proposed in Williams (Biometrics 27 (1971)
   103) and is sometimes referred to as the modified Williams statistic.
   It has many useful applications in biostatistical studies. In this
   article, we present an algorithm for calculating the distribution
   function of this isotonic range statistic for a general number of
   treatments k using recursive integration techniques and we provide
   tables of critical points for this test procedure. This allows the full
   implementation of this test procedure. We also show how this procedure
   can be used to construct a set of simultaneous confidence intervals for
   a set of monotone contrasts of the treatment effects and compare it
   with other multiple comparisons procedures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

   to random right censorship. Multiple testing procedures based on
   two-sample statistics, each comparing an individual treatment with the
   previous one, are proposed for determining the pattern of the treatment
   effects. The two-sample statistics under consideration are weighted
   logrank statistics (Fleming and Harrington, 1991, Counting Process and
   Survival Analysis. Wiley, New York) and weighted Kaplan-Meier
   statistics (Pepe and Fleming, 1989. Biometrics 45, 497-507; 1991. J.
   Roy. Statist, Sec. B 53, 341-352). An illustrated numerical example is
   reported. Finally, the comparative results of a Monte Carlo error rate
   and power study for small sample sizes are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier

AB The exact conditional distribution of a statistic for the many-to-one

   Williams (1988). His approach is expanded to other maximum statistics,
   and their exact conditional distributions are compared. As an
   alternative to the conditional approach, the exact unconditional
   binomial distribution is presented for two maximum statistics. For
   these distributions algorithms are described to compute the exact
   unconditional p-values and critical values. As an application of the
   exact unconditional distribution, a new simultaneous step-down
   procedure is suggested. This procedure is based on the exact
   unconditional distribution and is compared to the alpha-adjustment
   procedure according to Bonferroni-Holm and Hommel when p-values result
   from Fisher's exact test and Barnard's test. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science
