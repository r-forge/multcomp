  		Multiple Comparisons in R

	Frank Bretz, Torsten Hothorn and Peter Westfall


  o  Generate PDF under UNIX (or with gnutools installed)

	>$ make

  o  Generate PDF under Windows:

	R> source("compile.R")

  o  General Rules

     - put references in LaTeXBibTeX/references.in (NOT: references.bib)
       and run `make' on it (requires HSAUR package)

     - use macros defined in LaTeXBibTeX/bookhead.tex

     - don't use any special characters, only plain LaTeX (files will be
       UTF-8 encoded)

  o  Markup

     - sub- and superscripts in text, i.e. \pi^\text{ave}

     - Names in formulae in text, i.e. \text{FWER} (maybe define a macro)

     - cite references with \cite{label} or \citep{label} (and label is
       defined in LaTeXBibTeX/references.bib)

     - don't put colored text into document. Use \marginpar{comment}
       to comment on something.
