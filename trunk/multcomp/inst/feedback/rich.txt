Torsten,

I am finally getting to the multcomp_0.991-2.zip package.

Thank you for it.  It is a major improvement over the previous
version.  It looks smooth and elegant and capable.  It is much, much
faster.

And it is different.  In the MMC (Mean--mean Multiple Comparisons)
plot as implemented in the HH package on CRAN, I use two things that
have changed.

a. The specific structure of the glht object is not the same as that
of the hmtest object.  This change is not a serious problem, as the
confint and summary methods give me the numbers I want.

b. plot.confint.glht has replaced plot.hmtest.  This is a much simpler
and easier to understand function.

I am about 90% done on converting MMC from simint to glht.  I hope to
finish in the next few days.


I have a question on R packages, which might better be directed to
R-devel, but I will ask it here first.  There is no help page for
glht-class.  Why didn't R CMD check require you to write such a page?
When I create new classes, I am required to write man pages for them.

I see glitches that need repair.

1. These statements give different plots.
    plot(print(confint(wht))) ## % (without a number) and labels "H-M==0"
    plot(confint(wht))        ## 95% and labels "H-M"
This violates the definition of print() which is supposed to return
its argument unchanged.


2. wht <- glht(amod, linfct = mcp(tension = "Tukey"))

The wht object does not contain any reference to either the "whichf"
variable "tension" or the ylabel "breaks".  Neither does the
plot.confint.glht.  Please add both a "whichf" and a "ylabel"
component to the glht object.  I like the name "focus" (used by S-Plus
multicomp) better than the name "whichf", but this is a mild
preference.  I can find ylabel with
    as.character(terms(wht$model)[[2]])
I don't see any way to find whichf from the "glht" object.  I think
making it a component or attribute of the returned value of mcp
may be the right way to do it.



3. I think this is a bug.
> print.default(summary(wht)$test)  ## useful information
> summary(wht)$test                 ## error

         Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses

Error in `colnames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = c("Estimate", "Std. Error", "p value" :

>


4. why do I get different answers here?
>   plot(print(confint(wht)))
Estimated Quantile = 2.4183
> print(confint(wht))
Estimated Quantile = 2.4189
> attr(confint(wht)$confint,"calpha")
[1] 2.418232
>


5. I want a way to get the means of y, with full confidence intervals,
associated with each level of the focus factor.  S-Plus multicomp does
it with argument comparisons="none".  The best I have been able to do
with glht is the one-way example
   amod <- aov(breaks ~ tension-1, data = warpbreaks)  ## one-way
   wht.none <- glht(amod, linfct = mcp(tension = contr.treatment(3, contrasts=FALSE)))
   wht.none
I haven't figured out an incantation for two-way or higher.


6. I would like additional arguments for multcomp:::confint.glht.  I
want to specify both the estimated quantile and the p-value associated
with it.  I need this, for example, with the extended Tukey test where
I find the q-value from the Studentized range distribution and I want
to use those same q-values and p-values for a basis set of orthogonal
contrasts.  I will need to post-process the confint(wht)$confint to
get the intervals I want.


7. I want to plot the "glht" object directly.  I recommend a plot method
         plot.glht <- function (x, ...) plot(confint(x), ..)


8. One-sided Dunnett contrasts are not plotted correctly.  The line
should go to the right margin of the plot.  Instead, the line is missing.

  amod <- aov(breaks ~ wool * tension, data = warpbreaks)
  wht <- glht(amod, linfct = mcp(tension = "Dunnett"), alternative="greater")
  plot(confint(wht))

9. Documention still needs work.  I eventually figured this out
     glht(amod,
          linfct = mcp(tension = contrMat(rep(18,3), base=2)),
          alternative="greater")
   The almost-obvious solution doesn't work
     glht(amod,
          linfct = mcp(tension = "Dunnett", base=2),
          alternative="greater")
