AB In this paper, we address the problem of calculating power and sample
   sizes associated with simultaneous tests for non-inferiority. We
   consider the case of comparing several experimental treatments with an
   active control. The approach is based on the ratio view, where the
   common non-inferiority margin is chosen to be some percentage of the
   mean of the control treatment. Two power definitions in multiple
   hypothesis testing, namely, complete power and minimal power, are used
   in the computations. The sample sizes associated with the ratio-based
   inference are also compared with that of a comparable inference based
   on the difference of means for various scenarios. It is found that the
   sample size required for ratio-based inferences is smaller than that of
   difference-based inferences when the relative non-inferiority margin is
   less than one and when large response values indicate better treatment
   effects. The results are illustrated with examples. Copyright (c) 2005

AB Quality of life is becoming an important outcome for the comparison of
   aggressive therapies. To measure quality of life (QOL), questionnaires
   have been designed that ask patients about symptoms and functionality
   in several aspects of daily life. Primary analyses of such
   questionnaires typically focus on a summary statistic, such as a sum
   score or a single global question. This avoids inflated type I errors
   or loss of power due to multiple testing of individual items. In
   return, specific questions and answers that initially mattered to the
   patient may unfortunately get buried. To avoid reduced specificity and
   interpretability for both patients and physicians, we propose to also
   analyse all original questions. In this paper, we seek to detect items
   of the QOL questionnaire that differ significantly over observed
   treatments even in the face of multiple testing. We sequentially build
   a model that combines features which additionally discriminate between
   treatments. To achieve this, we draw on insights gained in the field of
   statistical genetics where one is often confronted with a vast amount
   of predictors, e.g. of a genotypic nature. Specifically, we adopt a
   permutation based approach to evaluate the null distribution of the
   maximum of many correlated test statistics and use it to build a
   regression model that explains QOL differences between treatment arms.
   We apply the new methodology to analyse QOL data in an observational
   study of four different treatments of breast cancer. We discover that a
   single question captures most of the observed treatment differences in
   this population. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The problem of adjusting for multiplicity when one has multiple outcome
   variables can be handled quite nicely by step-down permutation tests.
   More difficult is the problem when one wants an analysis of each
   outcome variable to be adjusted for some covariates and the outcome
   variables are Bernoulli. Special permutations can be used where the
   outcome vectors are permuted within each strata of the data defined by
   the levels of the (made discrete) covariates. This method is described
   and shown to control the familywise error rate at any prespecified
   level. The method is compared through simulation to a vector bootstrap
   approach, also using a step-down testing procedure. It is seen that the
   method using permutations within strata is superior to the vector
   bootstrap in terms of error control and power. The method is
   illustrated on a data set of 55 minor malformations of babies of
   diabetic and non-diabetic mothers. Published in 2005 by John Wiley &

DE Bonferroni; familywise; longitudinal; multiple testing; sequential
AB This paper describes a new type of sequential testing for clinical
   trials. The sequential nature of the data is not from additional
   patients, but rather from longer follow-up times. At each analysis, the
   null hypothesis that all treatments are equivalent in effect on the
   Outcome after that amount of time is tested. The trial might still have
   staggered entry or not, but the key feature is that a different
   statistical hypothesis is tested at each analysis. It is assumed that
   any effect of treatment is non-transient, allowing a conclusion to be
   drawn in favour of one treatment or the other based on a difference at
   a single follow-up time. It is shown that a general method based on the
   Bonferroni inequality can be used to obtain critical cutpoints for
   sequential testing, that controls the chance of a type I error for the
   clinical decision. This method is applicable regardless of the test
   used at each analysis. In the case of a two-armed trial with a Gaussian
   outcome variable, it is shown how simulation can be used to obtain
   critical cutpoints that maintain the chance of a type I error for the
   clinical decision. The methods are compared by Monte-Carlo simulation,
   and it is seen that in most practical cases the Bonferroni method is
   not very conservative. The Bonferroni procedure is illustrated on the
   results of a real clinical trial of Pirfenidone on pulmonary fibrosis
   in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome. Published in 2005 by John Wiley & Sons,

AB In many microarray studies the primary objective is to identify, from a

   these genes are considered prognostic in that their respective
   expressions are associated with the survival endpoint of interest. To
   assess this association requires specifying an appropriate measure of
   association a suitable test statistic and, as the number of genes is
   large, proper handling of multiplicity issues. In this paper, we will
   address these issues by utilizing a general correlation measure, a
   non-parametric test statistic, and control of the family-wise error
   rate by employing permutation resampling. Comprehensive simulation
   studies are conducted to investigate the statistical properties of the
   proposed procedure. The proposed method is applied to a recently

AB Many clinical studies have as their endpoint the time until some event

   interested in comparing several treatment or prognostic groups with one
   another in terms of their survival curves. When many such pairwise
   group comparisons are done, the chance of finding a false significance
   among all of the comparisons is inflated above the usual desired
   significance level. This paper investigates methods of adjusting the
   survival analysis for the number of comparisons being made. These
   methods are applied to a retrospective study conducted by the

AB Although populationation-based molecular association Studies are
   becoming increasingly popular, methodology for the meta-analysis of
   these studies has been neglected, particularly with regard to two
   issues: testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and pooling results
   in a manner that reflects a biological model of gene effect. We propose
   a process for pooling results from population-based molecular
   association Studies which consists of the following steps: (1) checking
   HWE using chi-square goodness of fit: we suggest performing sensitivity
   analysis with and without Studies that are in HWE. (2) Heterogeneity is
   then checked, and if present, possible causes are explored. (3) If no
   heterogeneity is present, regression analysis is used to pool data and
   to determine the gene effect. (4) If there is a significant gene
   effect, pairwise group differences are analysed and these data are
   allowed to 'dictate' the best genetic model. (5) Data may then be
   pooled using this model. This method is easily performed using standard
   software, and has the advantage of not assuming an a priori genetic
   model. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Soils, Ltd.

AB In a traditional pharmacokinctics (PK), bioavailability
   (BA)/bioequivalence (BE) study, the same number of time points and
   sampling times are used for each subject. Often, an indirect inference
   is then made on some PK parameters such as area under the plasma
   concentration curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C-max), time
   to maximum plasma concentration (T-max) or half-life. However, since
   these PK parameters are summarized from repeated measurements, a lot of
   information can be lost. The indirect inferences on some PK parameters
   are not always accurate. Taking the repeated measurements of the
   concentration curve into consideration, a functional linear model has
   been developed to compare concentration curves directly instead of the
   PK parameters. Considering the nature of repeated measurements, a
   multiple testing procedure is proposed to assess the equality of two
   concentration curves. A real data set is used to demonstrate the

AB In clinical trials or drug development studies, researchers are often
   interested in identifying which treatments or dosages are more
   effective than the standard one. Recently, several multiple testing
   procedures based on weighted logrank tests have been proposed to
   compare several treatments with a control in a one-way layout where
   survival data are subject to random right-censorship. However, weighted
   logrank tests are based on ranks, and these tests might not be
   sensitive to the magnitude of the difference in survival times against
   a specific alternative. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a more
   robust and powerful multiple testing procedure. This paper proposes
   multiple testing procedures based on two-sample weighted Kaplan-Meier
   statistics, each comparing an individual treatment with the control, to
   determine which treatments are more effective than the control. The
   comparative results from a simulation study are presented and the

AB Genetic association studies have identified important risk factors for
   Alzheimer's disease and other diseases. However, the ease with which
   these methods can be applied and the shear number of polymorphisms in
   the human genome has led to a well-characterized multiple comparison
   problem-given the number of genetic variants being tested, it is likely
   that many of the positive findings reported in the literature to date
   will prove to be false positive findings explained simply by random
   fluctuation in data and type I error. The disparity of findings in
   initial positive reports versus subsequent negative replication studies
   observed in the Alzheimer's disease literature underscores this
   problem. The problem of a high false positive rate can be addressed in
   part by using statistical correction for multiple comparisons in larger
   and statistically more powerful samples and in meta-analyses of smaller
   samples. National initiatives are now being considered to address this
   problem by encouraging sharing of genetic material. Of equal concern in
   planning future initiatives are methodological issues that are the
   domain of the epidemiologist. In fact, it is possible that disparate
   findings across case-control studies reported to date may be explained
   in part by problems in the design, analysis and interpretation of these
   studies. The involvement of epidemiologists may improve the situation
   in this regard. For example, population stratification bias, control
   selection bias and prevalent case bias can be minimized by careful
   study design and by appropriate statistical analysis. Regarding
   interpretation of case-control studies, a more careful consideration of
   the strength of evidence for a given genetic variant may help to temper
   enthusiasm for, or appropriately qualify, positive findings.
   Epidemiologists have well-developed causal criteria for this purpose.
   This paper reviews the current state of case-control studies of genetic
   variants in Alzheimer's disease from the epidemiological perspective.
   The problem of multiple comparisons and a high false positive rate is
   reviewed. The potential for bias in case-control studies of Alzheimer's
   disease is reviewed by way of example. Future initiatives to promote
   case-control studies of genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease can
   only benefit from increased awareness the tools of epidemiology.

AB Typical randomized clinical dose-finding studies consist of the

   in estimating relevant doses among those under investigation for
   efficacy and safety variables, such as the minimum effective dose or
   the maximum safe dose (or estimating both doses simultaneously).
   Step-down procedures have been proposed for comparing the standardized
   differences of the dose groups against placebo. In this paper we
   consider the ratio of population means and propose stepwise confidence
   intervals for these ratios. These confidence intervals do not require
   multiplicity adjustments and yield the same decisions as the associated
   test procedures. In addition, several power concepts are investigated
   within the present framework. The results allow sample size
   determination in the design phase of a study for the probability of
   estimating correctly the dose of interest. Auxiliary results of a
   numerical study show the range of application of these methods.

TI Non-parametric analysis of covariance for confirmatory randomized
   clinical trials to evaluate dose-response relationships
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE

ID CATEGORICAL-DATA; REGRESSION; STATISTICS; TESTS
AB In confirmatory randomized clinical trials that are designed to compare
   multiple doses of a test treatment with a control group and with one
   another, there are often statistical issues regarding compound
   hypotheses and multiple comparisons which need to be considered. In
   most cases the analysis plan needs a clear specification for the
   proposed order for conducting statistical tests (or for managing the
   overall significance level), which statistical methods will be used,
   and whether adjustment for covariates will be performed. There are
   several benefits of specifying non-parametric analysis of covariance
   (ANCOVA) for performing the primary confirmatory analyses. Only minimal
   assumptions are needed beyond randomization in the study design,
   whereas regression model based methods have assumptions about model fit
   for which departures may require modifications that are incompatible
   with a fully prespecified analysis plan. Non-parametric methods provide
   traditionally expected results of ANCOVA; namely, a typically small
   adjustment to the estimate for a treatment comparison (so as to account
   for random imbalance of covariates between treatment groups) and
   variance reduction for this estimate when covariates are strongly
   correlated with the response of interest. The application of
   non-parametric ANCOVA is illustrated for two randomized clinical
   trials. The first has a (3 x 4) factorial response surface design for
   the comparison of 12 treatments (that is, combinations of three doses
   of one drug and four doses of a second drug) for change in blood
   pressure; and the second example addresses the comparison of three
   doses of test treatment and placebo for time-to-disease progression.
   This clinical trial has comparisons among treatments made for a
   dichotomous criterion, Wilcoxon rank scores and averages of cumulative
   survival rates. In each example, the non-parametric covariance method
   provides variance reduction relative to its unadjusted counterpart.

TI Multiple comparisons in carcinogenesis study with right-censored

SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE

ID INTERLEUKIN-12; TESTS
AB This paper considers the practical problem in animal carcinogenesis
   experiments where several treatment groups are compared with a control
   group in a one-way layout and the observed survival data are subject to
   random right-censorship. Proposed herein are multiple testing
   procedures based on two-sample weighted logrank statistics, each
   comparing an individual treatment with the control, for determining
   which treatments are more effective than the control. The associated
   p-value of claiming a certain treatment is more effective than the
   control is also discussed. A test-based confidence set for the scale
   changes between each treatment and the control is then obtained. The
   comparative results of a Monte Carlo error rate and power study for
   small sample sizes are presented. Finally, a numerical example
   involving renal carcinoma in mice demonstrates the feasibility of the
   proposed multiple testing procedures and test-based confidence set.

TI Design and analysis for survival data under order restrictions with a
   modified logrank test
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB We previously proposed a class of ordered weighted logrank tests for
   analysing censored survival data under order restrictions, However, the
   power of these tests is asymmetrical with respect to possible
   alternative configurations, While it is superior in most cases, the
   power can be inferior to the non-ordered logrank test in extreme cases.
   We propose a modified ordered logrank test which performs uniformly
   better than the non-ordered test. The power of the modified test is
   equivalent to the generalized Jonckheere's test but its computation is
   much simpler, We give sample size requirements for sufficient power to
   reject the global null hypothesis at specified hazard ratios between
   the control group and the best group. Following Fisher's least
   significant difference (LSD) strategy for multiple comparisons, power
   investigations indicate that the nominal power for the global test
   carries over to the control versus best comparison during pairwise
   testing. The power for detecting intermediate survival differences is
   inadequate but the sample sizes required to detect such differences may
   be impractical in most applications, (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Testing for treatment differences with dropouts present in clinical
   trials - A composite approach
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID LONGITUDINAL DATA; MULTIPLE; INFERENCE
AB A major problem in the analysis of clinical trials is missing data from
   patients who drop out of the study before the predetermined schedule.
   In this paper we consider the situation where the outcome measure is a
   continuous variable and the final outcome at the end of the study is
   the main interest. We argue that the hypothetical complete-data
   marginal mean averaged over the dropout patterns is not as relevant
   clinically as the conditional mean of the completers together with the
   probability of completion or dropping out of the trial. We first take
   the pattern-mixture modelling approach to factoring the likelihood
   function, then direct the analysis to the multiple testings of a
   composite of hypotheses that involves the probability of dropouts and
   the conditional mean of the completers. We review three types of closed
   step-down multiple-testing procedures for this application. Data from
   several clinical trials are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; OPTIC NEURITIS
AB We describe permutation based sequentially rejective multiple
   comparison procedures useful in multiple endpoint assessments. We used
   Monte Carlo methods to compare the power of these newly devised tests
   to that of tests due to Helm and Rom as well as to the classical
   Bonferroni method. We illustrate applications of the methods with
   analysis of visual field data collected from optic neuritis patients.
   We conclude that the new methods are particularly useful when there are
   many endpoints involved, the data are significantly correlated, and/or
   the distributional assumptions are questionable.

TI MULTIPLE COMPARISONS PROCEDURES FOR COMPARING SEVERAL TREATMENTS WITH A
   CONTROL-BASED ON BINARY DATA
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we examine three approaches for comparing several
   treatments with a control with use of binary response data. The first
   approach relies on asymptotic theory applied to the Freeman-Tukey
   transformation of the observed proportions. The second finds an
   acceptance region based on the binomial distributions estimated under
   the joint null hypotheses. The third approach applies Dunnett's
   procedure to the binary data. We evaluated the actual overall type I
   error rates of the Freeman-Tukey test and Dunnett's procedure using
   both simulation and binomial calculations while we assessed those of
   the binomial approach using simulation. Based on their capability to
   preserve the desirable overall type I error rate, we provide
   recommendations regarding the choices among the three approaches for
   various occasions. In addition, we provide comments on the power of
   these three procedures.
