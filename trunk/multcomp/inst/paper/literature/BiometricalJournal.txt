AB The likelihood ratio summarizes the strength of statistical evidence
   for one simple pre-determined hypothesis versus another. However, it
   does not directly address the multiple comparisons problem. In this
   paper we discuss some concerns related to the application of likelihood
   ratio methods to several multiple comparisons issues in clinical
   trials, in particular, subgroup analysis, multiple variables, interim
   monitoring, and data driven choice of hypotheses.

ID FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MULTIPLE TESTS; STRATEGIES; VARIABLES
AB In the analysis of gene expression by microarrays there are usually few
   subjects, but high-dimensional data. By means of techniques, such as
   the theory of spherical tests or with suitable permutation tests, it is
   possible to sort the endpoints or to give weights to them according to
   specific criteria determined by the data while controlling the multiple
   type I error rate. The procedures developed so far are based on a
   sequential analysis of weighted p-values (corresponding to the
   endpoints), including the most extreme situation of weighting leading
   to a complete order of p-values. When the data for the endpoints have
   approximately equal variances, these procedures show good power
   properties. In this paper, we consider an alternative procedure, which
   is based on completely sorting the endpoints, but smoothed in the sense
   that some perturbations in the sequence of the p-values are allowed.
   The procedure is relatively easy to perform, but has high power under
   the same restrictions as for the weight-based procedures.

AB The problem of finding exact simultaneous confidence bounds for

   simple linear regression line for the control over a fixed interval is
   considered. The assumption that errors are iid normal random is
   considered. It is assumed that the design matrices for the two
   treatments are equal and the design matrix for the control has the same
   number of copies of each distinct row of the design matrix for the
   treatments. The method is based on a pivotal quantity that can be
   expressed as a function of four t variables. The probability point
   depends on the size of an angle associated with the interval. We
   present probability points for various sample sizes and angles.

   of another factor. For example, several new drugs to treat a certain
   cancer are being compared for both male and female patients. Previous
   research efforts were mainly devoted to models with homogeneous
   variances. The current paper is to address more common scenario where
   group variances are heterogeneous.

DE confidence bound; multivariate studentized range; simultaneous
   confidence; simple linear regression; union-intersection
AB The problem of finding exact simultaneous confidence bounds for
   differences in regression models for k groups via the
   union-intersection method is considered. The error terms are taken to
   be iid normal random variables. Under an assumption slightly more
   general than having identical design matrices for each of the k groups,
   it is shown that an existing probability point for the multivariate
   studentized range can be used to find the necessary probability point
   for pairwise comparisons of regression models. The resulting methods
   can be used with simple or multiple regression. Under a weaker
   assumption on the k design matrices that allows more observations to be
   taken from the control group than from the k - 1 treatment groups, a
   method is developed for computing exact probability points for
   comparing the simple linear regression models of the k - I groups to
   that of the control. Within a class of designs, the optimal design for
   comparisons with a control takes the square root of (k - 1) times as
   many observations from the control than from each treatment group. The
   simultaneous confidence bounds for all pairwise differences and for
   comparisons with a control are much narrower than Spurrier's intervals
   for all contrasts of k regression lines.

ID BOOTSTRAP
AB Currently, among multiple comparison procedures for dependent groups, a
   bootstrap-t with a 20% trimmed mean performs relatively well in terms
   of both Type I error probabilities and power. However, trimmed means
   suffer from two general concerns described in the paper. Robust
   M-estimators address these concerns, but now no method has been found
   that gives good control over the probability of a Type I error when
   sample sizes are small. The paper suggests using instead a modified
   one-step M-estimator that retains the advantages of both trimmed means
   and robust M-estimators. Yet another concern is that the more
   successful methods for trimmed means can be too conservative in terms
   of Type I errors. Two methods for performing all pairwise multiple
   comparisons are considered. In simulations, both methods avoid a
   familywise error (FWE) rate larger than the nominal level. The method
   based on comparing measures of location associated with the marginal
   distributions can have an actual FWE that is well below the nominal
   level when variables are highly correlated. However, the method based
   on difference scores performs reasonably well with very small sample
   sizes, and it generally performs better than any of the methods studied
   in Wilcox (1997b).

DE multiple comparisons; diversity indices; transformations
AB A common goal in statistical ecology is to compare several communities
   and or time points with respect to taxonomic diversity (usually species
   diversity). For this purpose, the current literature recommends the
   application of traditional ANOVA techniques to "replicates" of
   diversity indices. This approach is not even asymptotically correct
   because diversity index estimates have unequal variances, even when
   sample sizes are equal and even when the hypothesis of equality of
   diversity indices is true. It is shown that transformations of the data
   can not be used to remedy this situation. We construct an
   asymptotically correct method and illustrate its implementation using
   dinosaur extinction data.

AB In the past many multiple comparison procedure were difficult to

   multiple contrast tests. Numerical difficulties restricted the use of
   the exact procedures to simple, commonly balanced, designs.
   Conservative approximations or simulation based approaches have been
   used in the general cases. However, new efforts and results in the past
   few years have led to fast and efficient computations of the underlying
   multidimensional integrals. Inferences for any finite set of linear
   functions of normal means are now numerically feasible. These include
   all-pairwise comparisons, comparisons with a control (including
   dose-response contrasts), multiple comparison with the best, etc. The
   article applies the numerical progress on multiple comparisons
   procedures for common balanced and unbalanced designs within the
   general linear model.

TI Obtaining critical values for simultaneous confidence intervals and

DT Article
DE multiple testing; multiple comparisons; simultaneous confidence
   intervals; critical values
AB There are many situations where it is desired to make simultaneous
   tests or give simultaneous confidence intervals for linear combinations
   (contrasts) of population or treatment means. SOMERVILLE (1997, 1999)
   developed algorithms for calculating the critical values for a large
   class of simultaneous tests and simultaneous confidence intervals.
   Fortran 90 and SAS-IML batch programs and interactive programs were
   developed. These programs calculate the critical values for 15
   different simultaneous confidence interval procedures (and the
   corresponding simultaneous tests) and for arbitrary procedures where
   the user specifies a combination of one and two sided contrasts. The
   programs can also be used to obtain the constants for "step-down"
   testing of multiple hypotheses. This paper gives examples of the use of
   the algorithms and programs and illustrates their versatility and
   generality. The designs need not be balanced, multiple covariates may
   be present and there may be many missing values. The use of multiple
   regression and dummy variables to obtain the required variance
   covariance matrix is illustrated. Under weak normality assumptions the
   methods are "exact" and make the use of approximate methods or
   "simulation" unnecessary.

DE multiple comparisons; robust methods; bootstrap
ID BOOTSTRAP
AB For J dependent groups, let theta(8),, j = 1,..., J, be some measure of
   location associated with the jth group. A common goal is computing
   confidence intervals for the pairwise differences, theta(j)-theta(k), j
   < k, such that the simultaneous probability coverage is 1-alpha. if
   means are used, it is well known that slight departures from normality
   (as measured by the Kolmogorov distance) toward a heavy-tailed
   distribution can substantially inflate the standard error of the sample
   mean, which in turn can result in relatively low power. Also, when
   distributions differ in shape, or when sampling from skewed
   distributions with relatively light tails, practical problems arise
   when the goal is to obtain confidence intervals with simultaneous
   probability coverage reasonably close to the nominal level. Extant
   theoretical and simulation results suggest replacing means with trimmed
   means. The Tukey-McLaughlin method is easily adapted to the problem at
   hand via the Bonferroni inequality, but this paper illustrates that
   practical concerns remain. Here, the main result is that the percentile
   t bootstrap method, used in conjunction with trimmed means, gives
   improved probability coverage and substantially better power. A method
   based on a one-step M-estimator is also considered but found to be less
   satisfactory.
